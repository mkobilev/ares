TASTY/TASTELESS
Robots love to play the game Tasty / Tasteless ( well, or edible / inedible )
Since many robots with the tastes and preferences are different (just like people !)
by the rules of the game in the beginning of the leading robot tells the things which he considers tasty ( passed a list of strings )
Then the leader says the name of the subject , and the player has to answer , TASTY this thing or not (TASTELESS)
However, all modern robots have powerful processors , so even a second to think for them a very long time , and if
a player thinks about the answer for a long time , the robot leader believes that the player does not know the correct answer.
